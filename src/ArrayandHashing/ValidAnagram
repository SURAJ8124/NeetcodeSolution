242. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of different word or phrase
typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

approch:
1)Creating one hashmap that contains the frequency of each string value
2) first loop created and storing the frequency of s string
3) second loop iterate on t string and checking each character is present in hashmap
means actually it is checking frequency of that character if that value is present then remove it frequency.
